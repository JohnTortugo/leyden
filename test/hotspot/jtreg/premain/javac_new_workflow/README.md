# Proposed Leyden Terminal Stage Workflow

This is a new propsed workflow for the "terminal stage" of the [Leyden
condenser pipeline](https://openjdk.org/projects/leyden/notes/03-toward-condensers)

- The CDS and AOT caches are automatically generated with a single `java` command.

- The caches are stored in the file specified by the `-XX:CacheDataStore=<app>.cds` option
    - The implementation is still a work in progress. AOT integration is not done yet.
    - As an imtermediate step, the AOT cache may be stored in a separate file.

- The `-XX:CacheDataStore` option is intended to be a replacement for the existing
  `-XX:SharedArchiveFile` option.

- We no longer need a separate "training run". Instead, the `-XX:CacheDataStore=<app>.cds`
  option should be added to the command-line of the production run of your application. For example

    ```
    java -Xlog:cds -XX:CacheDataStore=javac.cds com.sun.tools.javac.Main ~/tmp/HelloWorld.java
    ```

- If the specified file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically when the JVM process exits:

    - The loaded classes and their compiler profile are dumped into a temporary file with a `.preimage`
      prefix. E.g., `javac.cds.preimage`
    - A JVM subprocess is launched to convert `javac.cds.preimage` to the final CDS image, `javac.cds`
        - See the end of `MetaspaceShared::preload_and_dump_impl()` in
          [metaspaceShared.cpp](../../../../../src/hotspot/share/cds/metaspaceShared.cpp)

- In the next run of your application, the `javac.cds` file will be automatically loaded at start-up. Your
  application will see the benefit of CDS (and soon, AOT).


- By default, the following VM options are used when `-XX:CacheDataStore=<app>.cds` is specified. This way, you
  can automatically use all the Leyden-premain optimizations without specifying any extra flags.

    - `RecordTraining` is set to `true` when the VM is *writing* the `<app>.cds.preimage` file.
    - `RecordTraining`, `ReplayTraining` and `StoreCachedCode` are set to `true` when the VM is *writing* the final CDS image file.
    - `ReplayTraining` and `LoadCachedCode` are set to `true` when the VM is *loading* the final CDS image file.
    - `CachedCodeFile` is set to `<app>.cds.code`.

  However, you can explicitly disable some of these flags for diagnostic purposes. For example, the
  following command-line will automatically generate `app.cds` and `app.cds.code` on its first run. However, it will
  only load `app.cds` on subsequent runs, but not `app.cds.code`.


    ```
    java -XX:CacheDataStore=app.cds -XX:-LoadCachedCode -cp app.jar MyApp

    ```

- See [run.sh](run.sh) in this directory for an example of using `-XX:CacheDataStore=<app>.cds`

## Notes

- For applications that do not exit automatically, you may need to hand-craft a training like this, so you
  app exits voluntarily, to allow the subprocess to be launched to complete the generation of `app.cds`.

    ```
    rm -f app.cds
    java -XX:CacheDataStore=app.cds -cp app.jar MyApp -exit-after-start
    ```

- In the future, we may add a `jcmd` option to connect to a long running JVM and trigger the creation of
  the CacheDataStore.

- By default, the subprocess is automatically forked at JVM exit. For debugging purpose, you can use the
  `-XX:+CDSManualFinalImage` option to disable the automatic forking. This allows you to debug the the
   subprocess more easily.
    - When `-XX:+CDSManualFinalImage` is specified, the JVM will create only the `<app>.cds.preimage`
      file at exit. It will then print out a command-line that you can execute manually to create the
      final `<app>.cds` file.

## AOT Code Generation

AOT support is not fully implemented yet. As of Sep 18, 2023, at the end of `MetaspaceShared::preload_and_dump()`,
the compiler will be executed to compile a single method, `String::charAt`. The nmethod will be stored inside the
`CachedCodeFile`.

The intended design is to, at this point, compile all methods that were recorded in the traing data during the
training run. This is TBD.
